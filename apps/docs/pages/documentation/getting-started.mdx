# Getting Started

## Installation

Inside your Next.js project directory, run the following:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>`npm install feelstatic`</Tab>
  <Tab>`pnpm i feelstatic`</Tab>
  <Tab>`yarn add feelstatic`</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
  Feelstatic comes with type definitions for TypeScript. If you are using TypeScript, you don't need to install any additional packages.
</Callout>

## Quick Start

### Add api route

Start out by creating a file called `[[...fst]].ts` in `pages/api/feelstatic`. This contains the dynamic API route handler for Feelstatic.

```ts filename="pages/api/feelstatic/[[...fst]].ts"
import { FeelstaticApi } from 'feelstatic/api';
import { join } from 'path';

export default FeelstaticApi({
  paths: {
    root: process.cwd(),
    pages: [join(process.cwd(), '/app'), join(process.cwd(), '/pages')],
    components: [join(process.cwd(), '/app'), join(process.cwd(), '/components')],
    images: join(process.cwd(), '/public/images'),
  },
});
```

It's important to specify and join the paths in this instance because when Next.js is built on Vercel, it only traces files that are necessary for the specific handler - in this case, the Feelstatic API. If the paths for your json and image files are not specified, Feelstatic will not be able to retrieve and display them.

### Add page route

Create a `page.tsx` file in `app/feelstatic/[[...fst]]`. This includes the Feelstatic application and makes it available on the website.

```ts filename="app/feelstatic/[[...fst]]/page.tsx"
import { FeelstaticPage } from 'feelstatic';

export default FeelstaticPage;
```

### Set environment variables

Three environment variables must be set.

```
FST_GITHUB_OWNER
```

Set this to the owner/person/organization of the github repository (e.g. `mikkeldamm`)


```
FST_GITHUB_REPO
```

Set this to the repository name (e.g. `feelstatic`)


```
FST_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Get your [github access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) and set it here.

<Callout type="default">
    You should only allow the token to access the repository that you are working with, and only choose the following permissions:
    - Read access to commit statuses and metadata
    - Read and Write access to content

</Callout>
<Callout type="info">
    Remember to set the environment variables in Vercel before deploying
</Callout>

### Create your first editable page

Now you can start adding editable pages. This is done by adding a `page.json` file beside any `page.tsx` files in the `app` folder.

Here is a small simple example of a page

```json filename="app/page.json"
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "Wow, is it so simple?!"
  }
}
```

Now you can import that `page.json` file in your `page.tsx` file and use its fields.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import page from './page.json';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{page.hero.title}</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Example

I will try to make as many examples as possible under the page **examples**, but for now you can look at the [dev](https://github.com/mikkeldamm/feelstatic/tree/main/apps/dev) site in the package folder.
